# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is based from instructions within The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).

Using Javascript's functions, loops, and conditional statements, I created a simple webpage that allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors with the computer using their browser's Javascript console. Creating this was a little bit challenging, but overall it was fun because I finally got to work with a "true" programming language.
